# MonzTweetBot
A quick way to send a combination tweet with a link attached. 

Put your keys and TwitterAPI stuff into the "secure.json" file

Put your tweets in "blurbs.txt" (one tweet per line)

Put your link(s) in "links.txt" (one per line)

run "python3 tweetbot.py" and if you did everything right, you'll have posted on twitter!

This can be automated, but check the commented code in the "tweetbot.py" file if you're having issues.
